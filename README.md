## Introduction

**Note: This package should be considered experimental. The API is not yet stable and may change from release to release.**

RDKit.js is the JavaScript distribution of cheminformatics functionality from the [RDKit](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit) - a C++ library for cheminformatics.

The project is leveraging web assembly to rollout a subset of the RDKit functionality that is relevant in any javascript context. The WASM module bundled with this package is compiled directly from the RDKit source code.

The functionality included in RDKit.js is decided by the RDKit core team and its community. Thus, if you use this package, your voice matters.

### What is the scope of this repository/project

This project is dedicated to:

1. NPM builds and releases of the RDKit core wasm module
2. Examples using the RDKit core wasm module in JavaScript and web frameworks
3. Any additional functionalities built **on top of** the RDKit core wasm module.

The scope of the project may however change over time.

### What is NOT the scope of this repository/project

Any changes to the core RDKit wasm module (also known as RDKit's MinimalLib) is out of scope of this project.

To contribute or keep track of the changes to the core RDKit wasm module, go [here](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/tree/master/Code/MinimalLib).

## Install

```bash
npm i @rdkit/rdkit
# or yarn add @rdkit/rdkit
```

## Using the RDKit package assets

### Option 1: Use the npm package distribution files

Once you have the RDKit package installed in your node modules, copy the following distribution files anywhere in your deployed assets.

- `node_modules/@rdkit/rdkit/CodeMinimalLib/dist/RDKit_minimal.js`
- `node_modules/@rdkit/rdkit/CodeMinimalLib/dist/RDKit_minimal.wasm`

**NOTE: Both files must be copied at the same location in your deployed assets for the library to work properly.**

### Option 2: Use the remote distribution files from [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/)

- `https://unpkg.com/@rdkit/rdkit/Code/MinimalLib/dist/RDKit_minimal.js`
- `https://unpkg.com/@rdkit/rdkit/Code/MinimalLib/dist/RDKit_minimal.wasm`

## Running RDKit.js in your JavaScript code

To use RDKit.js, load the javascript file and instantiate the wasm module inside the `head` tag of your `index.html`, before you run your application code:

```html
<head>
  <!-- ...other files and HTML tags... -->
  <!-- Load the RDKit JS file -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@rdkit/rdkit/Code/MinimalLib/dist/RDKit_minimal.js"></script>

  <!-- Instantiate the WASM module. The inline script below could live elsewhere inside your application code. -->
  <script>
    window
      .initRDKitModule()
      .then(function (RDKit) {
        console.log("RDKit version: " + RDKit.version());
        window.RDKit = RDKit;
        /**
         * The RDKit module is now loaded.
         * You can use it anywhere.
         */
      })
      .catch(() => {
        // handle loading errors here...
      });
  </script>
  <!-- ...your application code goes here... -->
</head>
```

## Usage

It is recommended to go through all the JavaScript examples available on the official website [rdkitjs.com](https://rdkitjs.com).

If you are using React.js, several additional examples using React.js are available at [react.rdkitjs.com](https://react.rdkitjs.com).

## NPM Releases

NPM releases are currently semi-automated with the following azure pipeline:

[https://dev.azure.com/michmoreaul/rdkit-js/\_build?definitionId=1](https://dev.azure.com/michmoreaul/rdkit-js/_build?definitionId=1)

Here are the guidelines to respect when releasing a new version of the package:

1. Always release a new package from the master branch
2. Use the following commit message format: "RDKit release \<version of the main rdkit release\>"

> Example commit message: "RDKit release 2022.3.3"

3. In Azure pipeline parameters, specify the RDKit version with underscores seperating major, minor, and patch version

> Example: 2022_03_3

4. If you are releasing an official release, do not forget to uncheck the **Is beta?** checkbox in the Azure pipeline parameters.

### Important note on npm versioning

The scope of this repository goes beyond the release of the RDKit wasm core module. Other utilities may eventually be included on top of the core module in the RDKit.js npm release.

Because of that, we need a versioning system that will keep track of 1) the RDKit wasm core module version (exact match with its parent RDKit release) AND 2) multiple npm release versions that can be published on top of a same wasm core module version.

With this in mind, we will version the package with the following convention.

1. For each RDKit release, a new version of the npm package will be released as <rdkit version>-<initial semver version>.
   > Example: when the 2022.03.3 version of RDKit is released, its first NPM released will be `2022.03.3-1.0.0`.
2. On each subsequent npm release using the same core module, only the semver version will be modified according to semver conventions.
   > Example: when a bug fix is made in a React component built on top of RDKit for version 2022.03.3, a new npm release `2022.03.3-1.0.1` will be published.
   > Example: when a new React component is built on top of RDKit for version 2022.03.3, a new npm release `2022.03.3-1.1.0` will be published.

## Website deployments

Website deployments for [rdkitjs.com](https://rdkitjs.com) are automated via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for each commit merged or pushed to the master branch.

Live demo URLs are also generated on each pull requests made to easily visualize changes before merging.
